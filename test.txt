A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.
At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself.
This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.	Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.
But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he	lived, like- wise.
But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.
We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us.
They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there.
'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says.
But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin'
like the good Lord gypped me.
It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case.
He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.
He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the
early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.
I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?
--but sometimes	there's a man.
And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal,
he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles.

Il dilemma del prigioniero e' un gioco ad informazione completa proposto negli anni cinquanta del XX secolo da Albert Tucker come problema di teoria dei giochi.
Oltre ad essere stato approfonditamente studiato in questo contesto, il "dilemma" e' anche piuttosto noto al pubblico non tecnico come esempio di paradosso.
Anche John Von Neumann, creatore della teoria dei giochi, si interesso' a questo dilemma, presentatogli dai due ideatori mentre lavorava al RAND nel 1948.
Il dilemma in se', anche se usa l'esempio dei due prigionieri per spiegare il fenomeno, puo' descrivere altrettanto bene la corsa agli armamenti, proprio degli anni cinquanta
da parte di USA e URSS (i due prigionieri) durante la guerra fredda.
Il corollario a questo dilemma, detto di Aie (dai nomi dei 3 professori universitari che lo teorizzarono nel 1988 Astegy, Inglot e Elghi)
prevede sempre che uno dei due tradisca l'altro.
